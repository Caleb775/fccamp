/* This is how you leave comments in javascript */

/* Below is how you make a variable and have a string "" attached to it*/
let read = "Read this Variable";
/* you can use '' or "" */
//let read = "Read this Variable"; or let read = 'Read this Variable';
// to log to the console you will use
console.log(read);
//When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later
// when you do reasign a let variable there is no need to use let again
read = "Reread this Variable";
